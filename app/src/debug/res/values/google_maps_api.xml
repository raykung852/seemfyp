    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    46:B7:29:70:CB:45:58:CC:7B:9D:68:08:14:4B:58:BE:07:53:C3:29

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
